        <h3>Achievements</h3>
        <h5>Capital One</h5>
        <p>Identified a shortcoming in the collections workflow which failed to support vulnerable customers with specific memory issues. In one example a customer had been wrongly charged fees for 2+ years without appropriate support. I escalated the error to the national vulnerability team and collaborated to set a bespoke for the customer. As a result, I was nominated for a recognition award and my case used as an example in future vulnerability training.</p>
        <h5>OpenExchange</h5>
        <p>Detected a major bug with a new Zoom update which affected live streaming, crucial to a large upcoming conference. I developed a workaround using OBS for my virtual meetings that day, and reported the issue to tech support urgently. As a result, we were able to revert to an earlier version of Zoom system-wide and prevent interruption. I was commended for my initiative and fast response, contributing to a successful high-ticket conference.</p>
        <h5>Tropichol</h5>
        <p>Optimized the stock ordering process and negotiated a switch to a more cost-effective supplier. This resulted in a ~Â£100/month saving and reduced time needed to audit and order stock weekly.</li>
        <br />
        <br />
            Developed a series of web apps as a learning aid and reference for ingredient preparation and cocktail recipes. This allowed new staff to learn recipes and prepare menu items independently, translating into greater effectiveness during bar shifts and more flexibility in scheduling staff to work on the bar, opposed to needing one-to-one support.</li>
